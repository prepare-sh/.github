### 🍿 A Fun Fact
On launch day, we sat in a café, waiting for people to sign up. After hours with no sign-ups, we thought about giving up. We took a break for some fresh air. When we came back, to our surprise, 150 users had joined! This moment showed us that sometimes, things take a little time, and it encouraged us never to give up too quickly.
