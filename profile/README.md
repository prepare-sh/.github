## Hey folks 👋

Welcome to **prepare.sh** github page.

### 🙋‍♀️ About Us

We are a small team with a vision to create the world’s best EdTech platform and we believe this is achievable.
Unlike giant corporations like Udemy or Coursera, we're not backed by investors or venture funds. We’re just a group of engineers with a firm belief that education must be accessible, fair, and free.

### 🌈 Our mission

Although we provide premium content too that helps us to maintain prepare.sh website, pay for running costs, our main mission is to provide free labs, courses, and interview questions to aspiring professionals.

Every subscription, every course, and every bit of support helps us move closer to our vision of making education universally accessible.

### 🤝 Our values

- Nothing half-assed. Ever. If we're doing something we do our absolute best or we don't do it at all.
- We obsess over details: Every single thing we put out there has to be killer. No shortcuts, no compromises.
- You don't need a fancy resume to be the best. You need that fire in you, that absolute conviction that you're going to change the entire established field by setting a new benchmark for them to be compared against - one where content is amazing, accessible, and free. If you're all in on that mission, you're our kind of people.
